          <h2>What is the COVID-19?</h2>
          <p>
            COVID-19 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been
            previously identified in humans. It was first identified in
            Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, where it has caused a large and
            ongoing outbreak. It has since spread more widely in China.
            Cases have since been identified in several other countries.
            The COVID-19 virus is closely related to a bat coronavirus.

          <p>
            It is thought to have a zoonotic origin. Genetic analysis has
            revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the
            genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B)
            together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at
            the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples
            (BatCov RaTG13). In February 2020, Chinese researchers found
            that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts
            of the genome sequences between the viruses from pangolins and
            those from humans, however, whole-genome comparison to date
            found at most 92%...

                      The first symptoms of COVID-19 and influenza (flu) infections are often very similar. They both cause fever and similar respiratory symptoms, which can then range from mild through to severe disease, and sometimes can be fatal.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                      Both viruses are also transmitted in the same way, by coughing or sneezing, or by contact with hands, surfaces or objects contaminated with the virus. As a result, the same public health measures, such as hand hygiene (hand washing), good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue) and good household cleaning are important actions to prevent both infections.
                    </p><br>
                    <p> 
                      The speed of transmission is an important difference between the two viruses. Influenza typically has a shorter incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) than COVID-19. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19.
                    </p><br>
                    <p> 
                      While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be higher for COVID-19. While most people have mild symptoms, approximately 15% of people have severe infections and 5% require intensive care in a hospital ICU. The proportions of severe and critical COVID-19 infections are higher than for influenza infections.

                      We know that the disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads between people in several different ways.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                      - Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, for example at a conversational distance. The virus can spread from an infected personâ€™s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. Another person can then contract the virus when infectious particles that pass through the air are inhaled at short range (this is often called short-range aerosol or short-range airborne transmission) or if infectious particles come into direct contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth (droplet transmission).
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                      - The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is because aerosols can remain suspended in the air or travel farther than conversational distance (this is often called long-range aerosol or long-range airborne transmission).
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                      - People may also become infected when touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus.
