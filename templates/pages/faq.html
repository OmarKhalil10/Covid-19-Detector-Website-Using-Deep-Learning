<h4>What are coronaviruses?</h4>
<p>
The first symptoms of COVID-19 and influenza (flu)
infections are often very similar. They both cause fever and
similar respiratory symptoms, which can then range from mild
through to severe disease, and sometimes can be fatal.
</p>
<p>
Both viruses are also transmitted in the same way, by
coughing or sneezing, or by contact with hands, surfaces or
objects contaminated with the virus. As a result, the same
public health measures, such as hand hygiene (hand washing),
good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into
a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue) and good
household cleaning are important actions to prevent both
infections.
</p>
<p>
The speed of transmission is an important difference between
the two viruses. Influenza typically has a shorter
incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of
symptoms) than COVID-19. This means that influenza can
spread faster than COVID-19.
</p>
<p>
While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar,
the fraction with severe disease appears to be higher for
COVID-19. While most people have mild symptoms,
approximately 15% of people have severe infections and 5%
require intensive care in a hospital ICU. The proportions of
severe and critical COVID-19 infections are higher than for
influenza infections.

incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of
symptoms) than COVID-19. This means that influenza can
spread faster than COVID-19.

<p>
While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar,
the fraction with severe disease appears to be higher for
COVID-19. While most people have mild symptoms,
approximately 15% of people have severe infections and 5%
require intensive care in a hospital ICU. The proportions of
severe and critical COVID-19 infections are higher than for
influenza infections.

The first symptoms of COVID-19 and influenza (flu)
infections are often very similar. They both cause fever and
similar respiratory symptoms, which can then range from mild
through to severe disease, and sometimes can be fatal.

<p>
Both viruses are also transmitted in the same way, by
coughing or sneezing, or by contact with hands, surfaces or
objects contaminated with the virus. As a result, the same
public health measures, such as hand hygiene (hand washing),
good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into
a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue) and good
household cleaning are important actions to prevent both
